# Tic Tac Toe Final
​​​
It's time to get political! Play Tic Tac Toe as either a Republican or a Democrat! No need to pick a side though because you get to play as both in this! The blue or Democrat player will go first and the first to three in a row wins! If no one can get three in a row before the spaces are gone then it's a tie! Every win is tracked for both sides aand they stay upon page refresh. No need to get upset because both political parties are winners in this game!

## Goals 
To create all of the functionality in the Data Model and start there first. I wanted to be able to play the game in the console first and I did which was awesome! I was able to do this by using only classes and one global variable within main. I wanted to understand why the Data Model is the source of truth for all functionality. I wanted to create a clean game of Tic Tac Toe and truly understand how the Data Model and DOM interact. Learn more about CSS and HTML styling and to keep it clean and follow style guides. I feel like this project was a hug learning opportunity and a success for me!

## Technology Used:
- *JavaScript*

## Challenges
- Very difficult to conceptualize starting only in the Data Model at first with the class files.
- Having only one global variable was difficult to understand.
- Formatting the tic tac toe board was very difficult to do using Grid. 
- Connecting the Data Model and DOM.

## Wins
- I learned exactly how the Data Model should be the one source of truth for all functionality.
- I leanred a lot more about Grid.
- My HTML and CSS felt very organized and clean, as I followed the styling guide very closely.
- Using only one global variable.
- I think the look of my comp came out really nice!
- Learned a lot about Class files and how they interact with the rest of javascript functionality.
